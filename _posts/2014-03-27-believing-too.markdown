                <p class="lead">I designed and painted this mural in Chicago's Block 37 building for <i>Re/View</i>, the special exhibition of the 2013 <a href="http://chidm.com/">Chicago Design Museum</a>. The design is motivated by the observation that our senses are not unbiased data collectors. The senses are inventive and pliable; they fill in gaps and invent content that is not always <i>there</i>.</p>
