	<p class="lead">I collage images from <i>Elementary Treatise on Chemistry</i>, the first modern textbook on the subject, written by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Lavoisier">Antoine Lavoisier</a> and published in 1789. In the introduction to his textbook, Lavoisier writes that in the present "we become interested in deceiving ourselves." He values the scientific method's ability to improve a discipline over time by identifying and correcting past mistakes. I use his images in hopes that the same might be the case with history.</p>
